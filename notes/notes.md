## 00.md Introduction to Elixir Workshop
This is a small Elixir workshop I put together.
I have fallen in love with Elixir. Mostly for pattern matching which we will get to eventially, but also because I have found that I like building code using functions rather than objects. Elixir is a functional language built on top of Erlang but looks alot like Ruby. In fact, Elixir was created by Jose Valim who was a Ruby developer and worked on popular Ruby gems like Devise, which is the defacto authentication gem for Rails.
